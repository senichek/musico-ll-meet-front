<p>It is a platform that aims to promote the organization of musical events, by facilitating the contact of musicians or groups (the Musicos) and the organizers (the MoMers). This app is a collaborative effort. I worked with 3 other studens of the school "O'Clock".</p>
<p>Here is how it works:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The organizer creates an announcement;</li>
    <li>The musicians can apply (submit their candidature);</li>
    <li>The organizer can review the submission to accept or refuse  it;</li>
    <li>The organizer can finalize the announcement to turn it into an event after all of of the submissions have been reviewed.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the users have the possibility to update their profile information, upload pictures, filter the events and delete their profile. The authentication is done using JWT.</p>
